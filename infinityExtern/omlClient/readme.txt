The oml4py-simple-example.py contains a simple example for pushing the OML streams. This example can be changed to push different components states of different testbeds. oml4py-simple-example.py requires the oml4py client, which can be downloaded here: https://github.com/mytestbed/oml4py

The oml4py client adds at the beginning of the component names always the domain name(testbed name)! but this will be ignored in portlet. If the names of the components needed to be specified otherwise, a simple java client OMLClientMock can be used (under xipimonitoring/src/test/java/org/fiteagle/interactors/monitoring/client) with a specified OML stream file (OMLServerTest class has an example of usage). An example of the OML stream file is xipimonitoring/src/test/resources/pushOMLString.txt.
